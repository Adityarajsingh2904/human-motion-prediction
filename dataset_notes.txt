# Dataset Setup

This project relies on three motion capture datasets:

- **Human3.6M** – registration required at
  <http://www.cs.stanford.edu/people/ashesh/h3.6m.zip>
- **CMU Mocap** – available at <http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/>
- **3DPW** – available at <https://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/3DPW/>

Download the archives and extract them into a directory of your choice. A
minimal folder layout might look like:

```
data/
├── h36m/
│   ├── S1/
│   ├── S5/
│   └── ...
├── cmu/
│   ├── train/
│   └── test/
└── 3dpw/
    └── sequenceFiles/
```

Provide the dataset location using one of the following methods:

1. Set the environment variable matching the dataset you intend to use:
   - `H36M_DATA_DIR`
   - `CMU_DATA_DIR`
   - `THREEDPW_DATA_DIR`
2. Or pass the directory path with the `--data_dir` command-line flag.

The command-line flag takes precedence when both are specified.
